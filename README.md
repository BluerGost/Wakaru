# Wakaru
A translation software to make life easy.

# Introduction
Wakaru(from Japanese word 分かる) meaning to understand.
I have been motivated to create this app because as someone who is working for a japanese company it is quite difficult to work without understanding the language.
During my job as a software engineer on daily basis I face the language issue. Most of the time I just search in google. But sometimes some text comes which can not be coppied. Thouse are difficult to deal with since you have to bring out your mobile phone and might not be accurate then. So, I have created this app so that you can translate word faster.

# Todo
1. Take Screenshot
2. Extract the text from the image
3. Search the image in google and return the translation to desired language
